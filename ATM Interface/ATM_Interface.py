# Project Summery - The ATMs in our cities are built on Python, as we have all seen them. It is a console-based application 
# with five different classes. In order to use the system, the user must enter his or her user ID and pin when it starts. 
# Once the details are entered successfully, ATM functionality is unlocked. As a result of the project, the following operations can 
# be performed: - 1. Transactions History 2. Withdraw 3. Deposit 4. Transfer 5. Quit

# Imported datetime module. It supplies classes to work with date and time 
import datetime

# Defined the class by the user
class User:

# Defined __init__(self) method within the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of an object as soon as the object is formed. 
# A default parameter, named 'self' is always passed in its argument. This self represents the object of the class itself.
